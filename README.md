# LeanEmote

In 11.2 the new emote /lean has some unique functionalities in broadcasting the emote portion. It always shows your emote on your client, but unless you target somebody when you do the emote it doesn't actually broadcast. This addon effectively forces the emote to target yourself in order to never broadcasst it to other players you target, and additionally hides your own and others' /lean emote.
